<!--
  Lists are a great way to manage time, figure out what needs to be done, and remember things. And it feels good when we check items off!

  We will learn about two types of HTML lists:
    <ul> Unordered lists
    <ol> Ordered lists
      
  For unordered lists, also known as bullet points, start with the <ul> tag and wrap each item in a <li> list item element. Like so:
-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Sous-Chef</title>
</head>
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>ğŸ§º Go to laundromat.</li>
    <li>ğŸ–¥ Code for 45 min.</li>
    <li>ğŸ’… Take a bubble bath.</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
